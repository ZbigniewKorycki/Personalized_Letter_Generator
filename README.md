<h1>Personalized Letter Generator</h1>

This Python script is designed to generate personalized letters by combining a template letter with a list of invited names. The script reads the template letter from a file, extracts a list of names from another file, and creates individualized letters for each guest by replacing a placeholder in the template with the guest's name. 

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 24.
